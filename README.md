# 🎬 Netflix Global Content Strategy Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview
This Business Intelligence project analyzes the content acquisition strategy of Netflix to understand its evolution from a content aggregator to a global production powerhouse. Using a dataset of **8,807 titles**, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to identify key trends in localization, genre dominance, and strategic pivots.


## 🔍 Key Findings
* **The "Originals" Boom:** Identified a **300% surge** in content production starting in 2016, marking the strategic pivot to Netflix Originals.
* **Hyper-Localization:** Decomposed the library to reveal that **India** is a 92% "Movie" market, whereas the **US** maintains a balanced TV/Movie ecosystem.
* **Target Audience:** Validated a strategy focused on **Adult Retention**, with "TV-MA" being the dominant maturity rating across the platform.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* **Microsoft Power BI:** Dashboard development and visualization.
* **Power Query (M Language):** Data cleaning, ETL, and null handling.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Calculated measures for complex aggregation.
* **Star Schema:** Dimensional data modeling for performance optimization.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `Netflix_Analysis.pbix` - The actual Power BI file (Download to interact).
* `Netflix_Research_Paper.pdf` - Full academic IEEE-style paper detailing the methodology.
* `netflix_titles.csv` - The raw dataset used for analysis.

## 📈 Visualizations Included
1. **Decomposition Tree:** For AI-driven root cause analysis of regional strategies.
2. **Area Chart:** To visualize the "J-Curve" growth of content over time.
3. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** High-level metrics for executive summary.
